# Project: A look at immigration data into the United States
---------

### Project Summary

This project aims to create an ETL pipeline using the datasets provided by Udacity.

The analytical database created could then aid analysts in identifying trends and patterns in immigration into the US. For example, they could try and identify whether there is a correlation between a cities demographic breakdown and the number of immigrants who's final address is that city or identify which type of visa is the most popular amongst US immigrants.

- U.S. City Demographic Data: This is a table of US cities and their demographics. Data sourced from: https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/

- Airport Code Table: This is a simple table of airport codes and corresponding cities. Date sourced from: https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes#data


### Project Steps

The project is broken down into the following steps:

Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
